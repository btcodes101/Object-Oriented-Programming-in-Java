# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java

This is a collection of my lab assignments for the course Object Oriented Programming (CS-504d). In this course, we came to know about the various OOP principles and how OOP can help us in getting a better design for our solution. We also came to know about how JAVA implements these OOP principles and what are the system defined packages and classes that help us in doing the same. We also learnt about UML and how to model real life problems. We learnt how to model problems in UML and then implement the solution through Java.

The course was really enjoyable as it gave me a good exposure to the basics of Java SE. I hope to utilise this knowledge in my future endevours.

At the end of the course, we were given a project to work with teams.

I have added Questions for all the Weeks for those who wish to practice and master core Java skills. Try solving yourselves first, before refering to the solutions. 

Throughout the course, we were encouraged to use the javadocs and tutorials available on the <a href = "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">Oracle's Official Website</a>. It is crucial to be able to look for solutions ,debug code by refering to the official documentation and online resources.
